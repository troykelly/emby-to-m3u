    """
    Execute parallel track selection for multiple playlists with budget constraints.

    Configures mesh topology for peer-to-peer agent coordination. Spawns concurrent
    track selection tasks (up to 10 parallel) and aggregates validated results.

    Args:
        specs: List of PlaylistSpec objects to process

    Returns:
        List of validated Playlist objects ready for AzuraCast sync

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If total cost exceeds $0.50 or time exceeds 10 minutes
        ValueError: If any playlist fails validation (<80% constraint satisfaction)

    Budget Constraints:
        - Total cost: <$0.50 across all playlists (enforced)
        - Total time: <10 minutes from start to completion (enforced)
        - Per-playlist timeout: 30 seconds for LLM track selection
        - Max parallelism: 10 concurrent tasks (configurable)

    Coordination Architecture:
        1. Initialize mesh topology for peer-to-peer coordination
        2. Spawn concurrent track selection tasks (limited to max_parallel_tasks)
        3. Each task executes LLM track selection via OpenAI Responses API + Subsonic MCP
        4. Aggregate results and validate against budget constraints
        5. Return validated Playlist objects for AzuraCast sync

    Memory Namespace:
        - ai-playlist/batch-executor/session-{timestamp}/total-cost
        - ai-playlist/batch-executor/session-{timestamp}/total-time
        - ai-playlist/batch-executor/session-{timestamp}/playlist-{id}/status

    Note:
        This function implements the execution layer. Actual LLM track selection
        happens in track_selector.py (to be implemented in subsequent tasks).
        Uses Claude Flow memory for coordination state.
