# GitHub Automation with Claude Flow

This document describes the comprehensive GitHub automation workflow using Claude Flow hive-mind intelligence for issue management and PR processing.

## Overview

The Aperim Template includes three powerful scripts that work together to provide complete GitHub repository automation:

1. **Issue Selector** - Intelligently prioritizes and selects the most important issue to work on
2. **Issue Worker** - Comprehensively implements issue requirements with testing and creates PRs
3. **PR Worker** - Systematically resolves PR issues and gets them to mergeable state

## Scripts Overview

### üéØ Issue Selector (`github-issue-selector.sh`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes all open issues using AI to select the highest priority work

**Key Features**:

- Epic identification and dependency mapping
- Priority analysis (P0, P1, critical, high, etc.)
- Business impact assessment
- Technical complexity evaluation
- Age and staleness consideration
- Milestone and sprint alignment
- Best practice selection criteria

**Usage**:

```bash
# Analyze and select best issue
./.agent/scripts/github-issue-selector.sh --repo owner/repository

# Dry run to see analysis without starting work
./.agent/scripts/github-issue-selector.sh --repo owner/repo --dry-run

# Select but don't auto-start work
./.agent/scripts/github-issue-selector.sh --repo owner/repo --no-auto-work
```

### üîß Issue Worker (`github-issue-worker.sh`)

**Purpose**: Completely implements issue requirements with comprehensive testing and PR creation

**Key Features**:

- Thorough requirement analysis
- Complete implementation of all issue requirements
- **Mandatory test creation** (even if not explicitly requested)
- Code quality assurance
- Progress updates on the issue
- Automatic PR creation and linking
- Best practice testing implementation

**Usage**:

```bash
# Work on specific issue
./.agent/scripts/github-issue-worker.sh --issue 123 --repo owner/repository

# Work without creating tests (not recommended)
./.agent/scripts/github-issue-worker.sh --issue 123 --repo owner/repo --no-tests

# Work without auto-creating PR
./.agent/scripts/github-issue-worker.sh --issue 123 --repo owner/repo --no-pr
```

### üîÑ PR Worker (`github-pr-worker.sh`)

**Purpose**: Systematically resolves ALL PR issues to get them to mergeable state

**Key Features**:

- Comprehensive PR analysis
- CI/CD failure resolution (ALL failures, no matter how minor)
- Code review comment addressing
- Code quality improvements
- Merge readiness verification
- Optional auto-merge capability

**Usage**:

```bash
# Work on specific PR
./.agent/scripts/github-pr-worker.sh --pr 456 --repo owner/repository

# Work on all open PRs
./.agent/scripts/github-pr-worker.sh --repo owner/repository

# Auto-merge when ready
./.agent/scripts/github-pr-worker.sh --pr 456 --repo owner/repo --auto-merge
```

## Complete Workflow Examples

### üöÄ Full Automation Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Let AI select the most important issue and work on it
./.agent/scripts/github-issue-selector.sh --repo myorg/project

# This will automatically:
# 1. Analyze all issues for priority and epic relationships
# 2. Select the highest priority issue
# 3. Hand off to issue worker
# 4. Implement all requirements
# 5. Create comprehensive tests
# 6. Create and link PR

# Step 2: Process any existing PRs to get them mergeable
./.agent/scripts/github-pr-worker.sh --repo myorg/project --auto-merge
```

### üéØ Targeted Issue Work

```bash
# Work on a specific high-priority issue
./.agent/scripts/github-issue-worker.sh --issue 789 --repo myorg/project

# Then ensure the resulting PR gets merged
./.agent/scripts/github-pr-worker.sh --pr [NEW_PR_NUMBER] --repo myorg/project --auto-merge
```

### üîç Analysis and Planning

```bash
# Analyze issues without starting work
./.agent/scripts/github-issue-selector.sh --repo myorg/project --dry-run

# See what would be done for a PR without changes
./.agent/scripts/github-pr-worker.sh --pr 123 --repo myorg/project --dry-run
```

## Hive-Mind Architecture

### Multi-Agent Coordination

Each script uses Claude Flow's hive-mind intelligence with specialized agents:

**Issue Selector Agents**:

- `researcher` - Repository and issue analysis
- `analyst` - Data analysis and pattern recognition
- `project-manager` - Priority and milestone evaluation
- `business-analyst` - Business impact assessment
- `technical-architect` - Technical complexity analysis

**Issue Worker Agents**:

- `system-architect` - Implementation planning
- `coder` - Code implementation
- `tester` - Test creation and validation
- `code-reviewer` - Quality assurance
- `technical-writer` - Documentation and PR creation

**PR Worker Agents**:

- `github-workflow-specialist` - CI/CD expertise
- `cicd-engineer` - Build and deployment issues
- `security-analyst` - Security vulnerability fixes
- `code-quality-checker` - Code standards compliance
- `performance-optimizer` - Performance improvements

### Memory and State Management

Each script maintains context through Claude Flow's memory system:

- Issue analysis and requirements
- Implementation progress and decisions
- Code changes and testing strategies
- PR status and merge readiness

## Key Requirements and Guarantees

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing

**CRITICAL**: The issue worker **MUST** create comprehensive tests for any code changes, even if testing isn't explicitly mentioned in the issue. This includes:

- Unit tests for all new functions/methods
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for user-facing features
- Error condition and edge case testing
- Performance testing where appropriate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Hive-mind initialization fails**:

```bash
# Check Claude Flow installation
npx --yes claude-flow@alpha --version

# Verify Claude Code integration
claude --version
```

**Memory or namespace conflicts**:

```bash
# List active hives
npx --yes claude-flow@alpha hive-mind sessions

# Clear specific namespace
npx --yes claude-flow@alpha memory usage --action clear --namespace problematic-namespace
```

**API rate limiting**:

```bash
# Check API status
npx --yes claude-flow@alpha health --api

# Configure rate limiting
npx --yes claude-flow@alpha config set providers.github.rateLimit 100
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
export CLAUDE_FLOW_DEBUG=true
export CLAUDE_FLOW_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Run scripts with verbose output
./.agent/scripts/github-issue-selector.sh --repo owner/repo --verbose
```
