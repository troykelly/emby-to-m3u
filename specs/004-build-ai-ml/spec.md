**Feature Branch**: `004-build-ai-ml`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build AI/ML agent that parses plain-language radio programming documents, generates playlist TODO list, uses LLM to select tracks via MCP, and syncs to AzuraCast"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: AI playlist automation for radio programming
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: System agent, Programming director (user), Radio station

   → Data: Programming docs, track metadata, playlists
   → Constraints: Cost <$0.50, execution <10min, fully automated, Australian content 30%+
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Resolved: Track quality = Constraints ≥80% + Flow quality verified
   → Resolved: Constraint conflicts = Relax in priority order (BPM→Genre→Era), keep Australian min
   → Resolved: Fully automated, no approval required
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary: Parse station-identity.md → Generate 47 playlists → Sync to AzuraCast
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Programming document, Playlist specification, Track, Daypart
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN: Some implementation details remain (specific to technical architecture)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: When the system encounters insufficient tracks to meet all playlist criteria (BPM, genre, era, Australian content), what should happen? → A: Relax constraints in priority order: BPM tolerance → Genre mix → Era distribution (maintain Australian content minimum)
- Q: Should the generated TODO list require user approval before track selection begins, or run fully automated? → A: Run fully automated (no approval needed)
- Q: How many playlists should be generated? → A: As many as required by the programming document (not fixed at 47)
- Q: On operational errors (API failures, network timeouts, rate limits), what should the system do? → A: Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts), if still fails then skip that playlist and continue with next
- Q: What defines "quality" for track selections - how should the system measure if selections are good? → A: Combined metrics: Constraints met (≥80%) AND flow quality (smooth energy progression, tempo transitions verified)
- Q: How long should decision logs and track selection history be retained? → A: Indefinitely

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
The programming director creates a comprehensive plain-language programming document describing the radio station's music strategy (dayparts, genres, BPM ranges, eras, Australian content requirements). The system automatically parses this document, generates all required playlists matching the specifications, intelligently selects appropriate tracks from the music library, and synchronizes all playlists to the broadcast automation system—fully automated without requiring approval, completing within 10 minutes and under $0.50 in processing costs.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** station-identity.md exists with programming requirements, **When** system processes the document, **Then** system extracts all daypart definitions, genre mixes, BPM ranges, era distributions, and Australian content percentages with 100% accuracy

2. **Given** extracted programming requirements, **When** system generates playlist specifications, **Then** system creates all required playlists (count determined by programming document) with correct naming schema (e.g., "Monday_ProductionCall_0600_1000") and matching requirement sets

3. **Given** playlist specifications for Monday morning drive (6-10 AM), **When** system selects tracks, **Then** selected tracks meet: 90-115 BPM (6-7 AM), 110-135 BPM (7-9 AM), 100-120 BPM (9-10 AM), 25% Alternative, 20% Electronic, 30%+ Australian content, 40% Current era

4. **Given** all playlists with selected tracks, **When** system syncs to AzuraCast, **Then** all playlists appear in AzuraCast, existing playlists are updated (not duplicated), and track metadata is preserved

5. **Given** complete workflow execution, **When** system finishes, **Then** total execution time is under 10 minutes and total API costs are under $0.50

6. **Given** LLM track selection for "energetic morning drive", **When** tracks are evaluated, **Then** playlist demonstrates smooth energy progression, genre diversity within constraints, and cohesive listening flow

7. **Given** insufficient tracks matching criteria, **When** system encounters constraint conflicts, **Then** system relaxes constraints in priority order (BPM tolerance first, then genre mix, then era distribution) while maintaining Australian content minimum requirement

### Edge Cases

- What happens when station-identity.md contains ambiguous or conflicting programming requirements (e.g., "upbeat but relaxing")?
- How does system handle playlists that already exist in AzuraCast but with different track counts or metadata?
- What happens when music library lacks sufficient tracks to meet all criteria (BPM, genre, era, Australian content simultaneously)?
- How does system behave when API rate limits are hit or network connectivity is lost mid-execution? System retries with exponential backoff (3 attempts), then skips problematic playlist and continues.
- What happens when track metadata is incomplete (missing BPM, genre, or country information)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST parse plain-language programming documents and extract structured data including dayparts, time ranges, BPM specifications, genre percentages, era distributions, and content requirements

- **FR-002**: System MUST generate all distinct playlist specifications required by the programming document (count varies based on document content), covering all defined dayparts including weekday, weekend, and specialty programming

- **FR-003**: System MUST use naming schema "{Day}_{ShowName}_{StartTime}_{EndTime}" for all generated playlists (e.g., "Monday_ProductionCall_0600_1000")

- **FR-004**: System MUST intelligently select tracks that simultaneously satisfy multiple criteria: BPM range, genre mix percentages, era distribution percentages, Australian content minimum threshold, and energy flow progression. When insufficient tracks exist, system MUST relax constraints in priority order: BPM tolerance (±10 BPM increments), genre mix (±5% tolerance), era distribution (±5% tolerance), while always maintaining Australian content minimum (30%)

- **FR-005**: System MUST check AzuraCast for existing playlists before creation and update existing playlists rather than creating duplicates

- **FR-006**: System MUST upload selected tracks to AzuraCast if not already present in the library, using existing duplicate detection logic

- **FR-007**: System MUST complete entire workflow (parse, generate, select, sync) in under 10 minutes regardless of playlist count

- **FR-008**: System MUST incur total API/processing costs under $0.50 per complete workflow execution

- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure Australian content requirement (30-35%) is met for all playlists through track selection

- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that all generated playlists meet their specified requirements and log validation results

- **FR-011**: System MUST generate a TODO list showing planned playlists and log it for reference, then proceed automatically with track selection without requiring user approval

- **FR-012**: System MUST provide progress reporting during execution showing current stage, playlists processed, and time/cost tracking

- **FR-013**: System MUST handle errors gracefully by retrying failed operations with exponential backoff (maximum 3 attempts). If operation still fails after retries, system MUST skip that specific playlist, log the error with details, and continue processing remaining playlists

- **FR-014**: System MUST log all decisions, track selections, and constraint satisfactions indefinitely in structured format (JSON or database) for audit, replay, and historical analysis purposes

- **FR-015**: System MUST validate track selection quality using combined metrics: (1) Constraint satisfaction ≥80% (BPM, genre mix, era distribution, Australian content requirements) AND (2) Flow quality verification (smooth energy progression between tracks, tempo transitions within acceptable range)

### Key Entities

- **Programming Document**: Plain-language text file containing station music strategy, daypart definitions, genre preferences, BPM requirements, era distributions, and content quotas. Contains unstructured data requiring intelligent parsing.

- **Playlist Specification**: Derived structured definition of a single playlist including name, day, time range, BPM progression, genre mix percentages, era distribution, Australian content minimum, and energy flow characteristics.

- **Daypart**: Time-based programming block (e.g., "Morning Drive 6-10 AM") with specific audience demographics, programming objectives, mood requirements, and musical criteria.

- **Track Selection Criteria**: Multi-dimensional constraint set including BPM range, genre category, era/year range, country of origin, energy level, and position in playlist flow.

- **Playlist Validation Result**: Assessment of whether generated playlist meets quality standards, including: (1) Constraint satisfaction percentage (must be ≥80% for BPM, genre mix, era distribution, Australian content), (2) Flow quality score (energy progression smoothness, tempo transition acceptability), and (3) Gap analysis identifying any unmet requirements.
