## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to generate an AI-powered playlist for a specific mood or activity. They open Claude Desktop, which connects to their Subsonic music library via the MCP server. The LLM analyzes the user's music collection, understands track metadata (genres, artists, moods), and creates a personalized playlist by selecting tracks that match the requested criteria. The playlist is returned as a formatted list with streaming URLs ready for playback.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Claude Desktop is configured with the MCP server, **When** user asks "Create a relaxing evening playlist", **Then** the LLM searches the music library, analyzes track metadata, selects 15-20 appropriate tracks, and returns a playlist with track names, artists, and streaming URLs

2. **Given** a music library with 10,000+ tracks, **When** user requests "Find tracks similar to Radiohead's OK Computer", **Then** the system searches by artist/album/genre and returns matching recommendations within 5 seconds (cache hit) or 15 seconds (cache miss)

3. **Given** the Subsonic server requires authentication, **When** the MCP server initializes, **Then** it authenticates using environment variables (SUBSONIC_URL, SUBSONIC_USER, SUBSONIC_PASSWORD) and validates connection before accepting requests

4. **Given** a user wants to discover new music, **When** they ask "What are my most-played genres last month?", **Then** the LLM retrieves library statistics, analyzes listening patterns, and presents a breakdown of top genres with track counts

5. **Given** Claude Desktop needs to understand the music library structure, **When** it queries available resources, **Then** it receives 6 resource types: library stats, artists list, albums list, genres list, playlists, and recent tracks

6. **Given** a user wants quick playlist generation, **When** they use a predefined prompt like "mood playlist", **Then** the LLM receives structured guidance on how to query the library, analyze tracks, and build mood-based playlists efficiently

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Subsonic server is unreachable during a request?
  ‚Üí System returns clear error message: "Unable to connect to music server. Please check your server status and try again."

- How does the system handle authentication failures?
  ‚Üí System validates credentials at startup and returns: "Authentication failed. Please verify SUBSONIC_USER and SUBSONIC_PASSWORD in your configuration."

- What happens when searching a library with no matching tracks?
  ‚Üí System returns: "No tracks found matching your criteria. Try broadening your search terms."

- How does the system handle very large libraries (100k+ tracks)?
  ‚Üí System limits all search results to maximum 100 tracks per query and provides clear pagination instructions to refine searches (e.g., "Showing first 100 results. Narrow your search by artist, genre, or year for more specific results.")

- What happens when cache expires during an active conversation?
  ‚Üí System automatically refreshes cache on next request with minimal latency impact

- How does the system handle malformed requests or invalid track IDs?
  ‚Üí System validates input and returns user-friendly error: "Invalid track ID. Please search for tracks first."

- What happens when multiple LLM requests occur simultaneously?
  ‚Üí System uses dynamic throttling that monitors Subsonic server response times and adjusts concurrency automatically. When server responds quickly, allows more parallel requests; when response times increase, reduces concurrency to prevent overload.

  - search_tracks: Find tracks by query string (max 100 results)
  - get_track_info: Retrieve detailed metadata for specific track
  - get_artists: List all artists in library
  - get_artist_albums: Get albums for specific artist
  - get_album_tracks: Get tracks for specific album
  - search_similar: Find similar tracks by artist/genre (max 100 results)
  - get_genres: List all genres with statistics
  - get_tracks_by_genre: Get tracks filtered by genre (max 100 results)
  - analyze_library: Return library-wide statistics
  - stream_track: Generate streaming URL for playback

- **Resources**: 6 data sources that LLMs can query for library context:
  - library_stats: Total counts and aggregate statistics
  - artists: Complete artist catalog
  - albums: Album collection with metadata
  - genres: Genre taxonomy with track counts
  - playlists: User-created playlists
  - recent_tracks: Recently added or modified tracks

- **Prompts**: 5 predefined conversation starters for common music tasks:
  - mood_playlist: Guide for generating mood-based playlists
  - music_discovery: Template for discovering new music
  - listening_analysis: Framework for analyzing listening patterns
  - smart_playlist: Rules-based playlist generation
  - library_curation: Organizing and cleaning music library

- **Subsonic Library**: The underlying music collection accessed via Subsonic API. Contains tracks with metadata (title, artist, album, genre, year, duration, bitrate), organized by artists and albums, with support for playlists and favorites.

- **Cache**: In-memory storage with 5-minute TTL that stores frequently accessed data (artist lists, genre statistics, library stats) to reduce Subsonic server load and improve response times.

- **Configuration**: Environment-based settings (SUBSONIC_URL, SUBSONIC_USER, SUBSONIC_PASSWORD) that control server connection and authentication.

## Open Questions for Stakeholder Clarification

1. ~~**Large Library Performance**: For libraries with 100,000+ tracks, what is the acceptable maximum response time for search operations? Should the system implement pagination, result limiting, or progressive loading?~~ **RESOLVED**: Cap at 100 results with pagination guidance

2. ~~**Concurrent Request Handling**: When multiple LLM requests arrive simultaneously (e.g., multiple Claude Desktop instances), should the system queue requests, process in parallel, or implement intelligent throttling?~~ **RESOLVED**: Dynamic throttling based on server response times

3. ~~**Error Recovery During Downtime**: If the Subsonic server becomes unavailable during operation, should the system retry, return stale cache, or fail immediately?~~ **RESOLVED**: Fail immediately with clear error message

4. ~~**Rate Limiting Strategy**: Should the MCP server implement rate limiting to protect the Subsonic server from excessive requests?~~ **RESOLVED**: No fixed rate limit, rely on dynamic throttling only
