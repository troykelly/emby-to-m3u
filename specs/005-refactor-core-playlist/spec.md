## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: When the music library lacks sufficient tracks to meet daypart criteria (e.g., only 10 Australian electronic tracks exist but 30 are needed for a 2-hour specialty show), how should the system respond? ‚Üí A: Relax constraints progressively (e.g., expand BPM range ¬±10) until sufficient tracks found
- Q: What is the acceptable variance percentage for genre distribution compliance (FR-022)? For example, if a daypart specifies "25% Contemporary Alternative," what deviation is acceptable before flagging non-compliance? ‚Üí A: ¬±10% tolerance (15-35% acceptable for 25% target)
- Q: When track BPM or other critical metadata is missing from the music library, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Data should be retrieved (and cached permanently) from LastFM and if it still unavailable use aubio
- Q: When generating multiple playlists with a total cost budget (FR-009), how should the budget be distributed across playlists? ‚Üí A: Total cost budget configurable as hard or suggested (with warnings). Hard limit uses dynamic allocation. Both configurable via environment variables, defaulting to suggested and dynamic
- Q: What happens if station-identity.md is updated with new programming rules while playlists are being generated? ‚Üí A: Lock station-identity.md during generation to prevent concurrent updates

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Production City Radio programming director, I need the playlist generator to automatically create hour-by-hour playlists that match our station identity programming document, so that our music selection maintains consistent quality, adheres to regulatory requirements (30% Australian content), and serves our target demographic of creative industry professionals with appropriate genre mixes, BPM ranges, and daypart-specific energy levels.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the station-identity.md document is loaded, **When** generating a "Morning Drive: Production Call (6:00 AM - 10:00 AM)" playlist, **Then** the system produces a playlist with:
   - 12-14 songs per hour with BPM progression 90-115 (6-7 AM) ‚Üí 110-135 (7-9 AM) ‚Üí 100-120 (9-10 AM)
   - Genre mix: 25% Contemporary Alternative, 20% Electronic/Downtempo, 20% Quality Pop/R&B, 15% Global Sounds, 10% Jazz/Neo-Soul
   - Minimum 30% Australian artists
   - Era mix: 40% current (0-2 years), 35% recent (2-5 years), 20% modern classics (5-10 years), 5% throwbacks (10-20 years)
   - Uplifting, positive mood with strong intros suitable for drive time

2. **Given** multiple daypart specifications exist in station-identity.md, **When** generating playlists for a full broadcast day, **Then** the system creates distinct playlists for each daypart (Morning Drive, Midday Session, Afternoon Drive, Evening, Late Night) with appropriate:
   - BPM ranges specific to the time of day
   - Genre distributions matching daypart requirements
   - Talk/music ratios (e.g., minimal talk during Midday, more features during Drive times)
   - Rotation strategies (Power/Medium/Light rotation percentages)

3. **Given** the AI/ML playlist generator has access to the music library via existing endpoints, **When** selecting tracks for a playlist, **Then** the system:
   - Queries available tracks from Subsonic/Emby API
   - Applies selection criteria from the relevant daypart specification
   - Validates track metadata (BPM, genre, year, country) against requirements
   - Provides reasoning for each track selection aligned with station programming goals

4. **Given** a daypart specification includes specialty programming (e.g., "Wednesday: Australian Spotlight 7-9 PM - 100% Australian artists"), **When** generating that specialty playlist, **Then** the system:
   - Selects only tracks from Australian artists
   - Maintains appropriate BPM and genre diversity within the Australian catalog
   - Documents the specialty programming constraint in the playlist metadata

5. **Given** the Australian content requirement is 30% minimum, **When** validating any generated playlist, **Then** the system:
   - Calculates the percentage of Australian tracks
   - Flags playlists below 30% as non-compliant
   - Provides Australian artist alternatives when needed to meet quota

### Edge Cases
- When the music library doesn't have enough tracks matching a specific daypart's criteria (e.g., insufficient Australian electronic tracks with BPM 115-130), the system progressively relaxes constraints (e.g., expand BPM range ¬±10, then ¬±15) until sufficient tracks are found, logging each relaxation step
- How does the system handle conflicting requirements (e.g., a specialty show requiring 100% jazz when the library has limited jazz tracks meeting BPM requirements)?
- The system locks station-identity.md during playlist generation to prevent concurrent updates, ensuring consistency across all playlists in a batch; new programming rules apply only to subsequent generation runs after lock release
- How does the system ensure no song repeats within a 5-hour daypart (e.g., Midday requirement: "no-repeat workday" experience)?
- When BPM or other critical metadata is missing for tracks, the system retrieves data from Last.fm API and caches permanently; if still unavailable, analyzes audio using aubio-tools to extract BPM and caches the result

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Station Identity Integration
- **FR-001**: System MUST load and parse station-identity.md to extract all daypart specifications including name, time range, BPM progression, genre mix percentages, era distribution, mood/energy guidelines, and content focus
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multiple programming structures (Monday-Friday, Weekend Saturday/Sunday) with distinct daypart definitions for each schedule
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract and enforce rotation strategy categories (Power Rotation 60-70 spins/week, Medium Rotation 35 spins/week, Light Rotation 10-14 spins/week, Recurrent, Library/Gold)
- **FR-004**: System MUST recognize specialty programming constraints (e.g., 100% Australian, 100% Electronic, theme-based hours) and generate playlists accordingly
- **FR-031**: System MUST acquire an exclusive lock on station-identity.md at the start of playlist generation batch and release lock upon completion, preventing concurrent modifications during generation to ensure consistency across all playlists

#### AI/ML Playlist Generation
- **FR-005**: System MUST use AI/ML capabilities to select tracks that match daypart criteria with explainable reasoning for each selection
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate playlists that satisfy multiple concurrent constraints (BPM range, genre mix, era distribution, Australian content, mood/energy, rotation category)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide selection reasoning for each track that references station programming objectives (e.g., "Selected for Morning Drive energy level and positive lyrical content")
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate target track count based on daypart duration and tracks-per-hour specification (e.g., 12-14 songs/hour for Morning Drive = 48-56 tracks for 4-hour show)
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement cost controls for LLM API usage with configurable total budget mode (hard limit or suggested with warnings) and allocation strategy (dynamic based on complexity or equal distribution), both configurable via environment variables with defaults: suggested budget mode and dynamic allocation
- **FR-030**: System MUST dynamically allocate budget across playlists when hard limit mode is enabled, adjusting per-playlist cost based on playlist complexity and constraint satisfaction requirements; MUST warn operators when suggested budget mode is exceeded but continue generation

#### Track Selection & Validation
- **FR-010**: System MUST query music library (via existing Subsonic/Emby endpoints) to retrieve available tracks with metadata (title, artist, album, BPM, genre, year, country)
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate track metadata against daypart requirements before inclusion in playlist
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce no-repeat rules within specified time windows (e.g., no song repeats in 5-hour Midday block)
- **FR-013**: System MUST calculate and enforce Australian content percentage (minimum 30%) across all playlists
- **FR-014**: System MUST support BPM progression requirements (e.g., Morning Drive: 90-115 ‚Üí 110-135 ‚Üí 100-120 over 4 hours)
- **FR-015**: System MUST apply mood/energy filters (e.g., exclude melancholy ballads from Morning Drive, avoid aggressive tracks during Midday)
- **FR-028**: System MUST implement progressive constraint relaxation when insufficient tracks are available (expand BPM range in ¬±10 BPM increments, then relax genre/era constraints), logging each relaxation step in decision log
- **FR-029**: System MUST retrieve missing track metadata (BPM, genre, etc.) from Last.fm API and cache permanently; if unavailable from Last.fm, MUST analyze audio files using aubio-tools to extract BPM and other audio features, caching results for future use

#### Playlist Output & Integration
- **FR-016**: System MUST generate playlists in M3U format compatible with existing AzuraCast sync workflow
- **FR-017**: System MUST generate playlist metadata files containing validation results (constraint satisfaction scores, BPM variance, energy progression, genre diversity)
- **FR-018**: System MUST create decision logs documenting AI selection reasoning, track criteria, validation results, and cost metrics for audit purposes
- **FR-019**: System MUST integrate with existing reporting system to generate Markdown and PDF reports of playlist generation

#### Regulatory & Programming Compliance

## Notes for Planning Phase

1. **Integration with Existing System**: This refactor should preserve existing M3U generation, AzuraCast sync, and reporting capabilities while replacing manual playlist logic with AI/ML-driven track selection using station-identity.md context.

2. **Live Testing Environment**: Testing will be conducted against actual Subsonic/Emby endpoints using credentials from environment variables (SUBSONIC_URL, SUBSONIC_USER, SUBSONIC_PASSWORD). Ensure test suite can validate against real music library data.

3. **Station Identity as Programming Source**: The station-identity.md file becomes the single source of truth for programming rules. File locking must be implemented to prevent concurrent modifications during generation (FR-031).

4. **Cost Management**: AI/ML usage requires configurable cost controls via environment variables - budget mode (hard/suggested, default: suggested) and allocation strategy (dynamic/equal, default: dynamic). See FR-009 and FR-030.

5. **Metadata Enhancement**: System must retrieve missing track metadata from Last.fm API with permanent caching, falling back to aubio-tools audio analysis when Last.fm data unavailable (FR-029). Ensure aubio-tools is available in deployment environment.
