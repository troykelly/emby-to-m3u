### 3. Type Safety (MyPy)

✅ **PASSED**
- Strict type checking: **0 errors**
- All 20 source files pass strict MyPy validation

### 4. Code Quality (Pylint)

⚠️ **FAILED** (by 0.01 points)
- Score: **8.99/10**
- Requirement: ≥9.0
- Previous run: 9.01/10 (regression of -0.02)

**Issues Found:**
1. `models/validation.py:16` - Too many instance attributes (11/10)
2. `models/validation.py:93, 108, 124` - Missing explicit re-raise (W0707)
3. Code duplication between `models/core.py`, `models/llm.py`, and `models/validation.py`

### 5. Code Formatting (Black)

⚠️ **FAILED**
- 1 file needs reformatting: `document_parser.py`
- 19 files are properly formatted

### 6. Module Size Compliance

⚠️ **FAILED**
- 1 file exceeds 500 lines:
  - `track_selector.py` - **508 lines** (8 lines over limit)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **CRITICAL: Increase Test Coverage (24.41% → 90%)**
   - Focus on high-value modules first:
     - `validator.py` - Core business logic
     - `document_parser.py` - Critical input processing
     - `track_selector.py` - Main functionality
     - `workflow.py` - Orchestration logic
   - Add integration tests for:
     - `mcp_connector.py`
     - `openai_client.py`
     - `azuracast_sync.py`
   - Add CLI tests for `cli.py`

2. **Fix Pylint Score (8.99 → 9.0)**
   - Reduce instance attributes in `models/validation.py` (use composition)
   - Add explicit exception chaining (`raise ... from exc`)
   - Refactor duplicate code in models

3. **Format Code with Black**
   ```bash
   black src/ai_playlist/document_parser.py
   ```

4. **Reduce Module Size**
   - Refactor `track_selector.py` (508 → <500 lines)
   - Split into multiple modules or extract helper functions

5. **Investigate Test Failures**
   - Review integration test failures in AzuraCast sync
   - Fix test timeout issues (possibly performance tests)
   - Ensure all mocked dependencies are correctly configured

### Estimated Effort to Reach 90% Coverage

**Coverage Gap: 65.59%** (24.41% → 90%)

- **Statements to Cover: ~1,340** (of 1,545 missing)
- **Estimated Tests Needed: 100-150** additional test cases
- **Estimated Effort: 16-24 hours** of focused test development
- **Priority Order:**
  1. Core business logic (validator, track_selector, workflow)
  2. Input/output handlers (document_parser, cli)
  3. External integrations (mcp_connector, openai_client, azuracast_sync)
  4. Supporting modules (decision_logger, playlist_planner, batch_executor)

### Testing Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Logic (Target: 50% overall)**
- Add comprehensive unit tests for `validator.py`
- Add edge case tests for `track_selector.py`
- Add workflow integration tests

**Phase 2: I/O and CLI (Target: 70% overall)**
- Add document parser tests (various formats, edge cases)
- Add CLI command tests (all flags, error cases)
- Add decision logger tests

**Phase 3: External Integrations (Target: 85% overall)**
- Add MCP connector tests (mocked external calls)
- Add OpenAI client tests (API contract validation)
- Add AzuraCast sync tests (upload scenarios)

**Phase 4: Final Push (Target: ≥90% overall)**
- Fill coverage gaps identified by coverage report
- Add missing edge cases
- Add error path tests
- Add concurrent execution tests

## Conclusion

**VERDICT: ❌ DOES NOT MEET QUALITY REQUIREMENTS**

The AI Playlist feature implementation is **not ready for production** due to insufficient test coverage (24.41% vs 90% requirement). While the codebase passes strict type checking with MyPy (0 errors) and has well-structured models, the lack of comprehensive test coverage presents significant risk.

**Blocker Issues:**
1. **Test coverage at 24.41%** - 65.59% gap to requirement
2. Pylint score 0.01 below threshold
3. Code formatting issue in 1 file
4. Module size violation in 1 file

**Estimated Time to Compliance:** 20-30 hours of additional test development and refinement.

**Recommendation:** Continue development in feature branch. Do NOT merge to main until:
- Overall coverage ≥90%
- Pylint score ≥9.0
- All files formatted with Black
- All modules <500 lines
- All tests passing
