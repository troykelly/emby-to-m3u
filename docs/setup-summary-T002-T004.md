## T002 - Dependencies Installation

### Changes Made:
1. **Updated `/workspaces/emby-to-m3u/requirements.txt`**
   - Added: `openai>=1.0.0`
   - Existing dependencies verified:
     - `pytest-asyncio==0.25.2` ✓
     - `pytest-mock==3.15.0` ✓

2. **Installed Dependencies**
   - Successfully installed OpenAI 2.1.0
   - All dependencies installed without conflicts
   - Verified installation: OpenAI version 2.1.0

3. **Development Tools Installed**
   - Black 25.1.0
   - Pylint 3.3.7
   - MyPy 1.16.1

## T004 - Linting & Type Checking Configuration

### Created `/workspaces/emby-to-m3u/pyproject.toml`

#### Black Configuration
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ['py310', 'py311', 'py312']
```
- Line length: 100 characters ✓
- Python 3.10+ support ✓

#### Pylint Configuration
```toml
[tool.pylint.main]
fail-under = 9.0  # Target score ≥9.0
```
- Target score: 9.0+ ✓
- Current score: **9.55/10** ✓ (exceeds requirement)
- Max line length: 100 ✓

#### MyPy Configuration
```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.10"
disallow_untyped_defs = true
strict_equality = true
# ... (strict type checking enabled)

[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = "src.ai_playlist.*"
# Strict type checking for AI playlist module
```
- Strict type checking enabled ✓
- Special strict configuration for `src/ai_playlist/` ✓
- Third-party library exceptions configured ✓

#### Pytest Configuration
```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
addopts = [
    "--cov=src",
    "--cov-fail-under=90",  # 90% coverage requirement
]
```
- 90% coverage requirement ✓
- Async test support ✓

## Verification Tests

### Black Test
```bash
black --check /workspaces/emby-to-m3u/src/ai_playlist/
```
✓ All done! 1 file would be left unchanged.

### Pylint Test
```bash
pylint /workspaces/emby-to-m3u/src/ai_playlist/
```
✓ Your code has been rated at **9.55/10** (exceeds 9.0 target)

### MyPy Test
```bash
mypy /workspaces/emby-to-m3u/src/ai_playlist/
```
✓ Configuration validated (found type issues in models.py for future fixing)

## Files Modified
1. `/workspaces/emby-to-m3u/requirements.txt` - Added openai dependency
2. `/workspaces/emby-to-m3u/pyproject.toml` - Created with complete linting/type checking config

## Constitution Compliance
- ✓ 90% test coverage requirement configured
- ✓ Pylint score ≥9.0 (currently 9.55/10)
- ✓ Black formatting (line length 100)
- ✓ MyPy strict type checking enabled
- ✓ All dependencies installed and verified

## Next Steps
The existing `src/ai_playlist/models.py` has some type annotation issues that will need to be addressed:
- Missing return type annotations (15 errors)
- Missing type parameters for generic Dict types

These can be addressed by the implementation team in subsequent tasks.

## Hive Coordination
- Pre-task hook: Registered task start
- Post-task hook: Task T002-T004 completed
- Notification: "Dependencies and linting configuration completed successfully"
