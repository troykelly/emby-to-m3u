# T003 Environment Verification Report

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Task**: Verify environment configuration and API access for AI playlist feature
**Status**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Critical Configuration Missing

## Summary

The environment is **NOT READY FOR AI FEATURE DEVELOPMENT** due to missing OpenAI API key. This is a critical blocker that must be resolved before proceeding with AI playlist generation.

## Critical Components

### ❌ OpenAI API
- **Status**: NOT CONFIGURED
- **API Key**: NOT SET
- **Test Result**: Cannot test - no API key present
- **Impact**: AI playlist generation CANNOT proceed
- **Action Required**: **URGENT** - Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

### ✅ Python Dependencies
- **openai**: ✅ Installed and ready
- **requests**: ✅ Installed and ready

## Optional Components (Available)

### ✅ AzuraCast API
- **Status**: CONFIGURED
- **Host**: https://radio.production.city
- **API Key**: SET (49 characters)
- **Station ID**: 2
- **Test Result**: Not tested (can test when needed)
- **Impact**: Playlist upload capability available

### ⚠️ Subsonic MCP Server
- **Status**: NOT CONFIGURED
- **Impact**: Music catalog access unavailable
- **Mitigation**: Can use mocked data for testing
- **Action Required**: Configure if real music data needed

## Environment Variables Status

```
❌ OPENAI_API_KEY: NOT SET (CRITICAL - REQUIRED)
⚠️ SUBSONIC_MCP_URL: NOT SET (optional for testing)
✅ AZURACAST_HOST: SET (https://radio.production.city)
✅ AZURACAST_API_KEY: SET (49 chars)
✅ AZURACAST_STATIONID: SET (2)
```

## Testing Capabilities

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Unit Tests | ⚠️ Blocked | Need OpenAI API key |
| AI Logic Tests | ❌ Blocked | Cannot test AI without API key |
| Integration Tests | ⚠️ Partial | AzuraCast available, Subsonic missing |
| E2E Tests | ❌ Blocked | Need OpenAI API key |

## Required Actions

### 1. Configure OpenAI API Key (CRITICAL)

**Priority**: URGENT - Blocking all AI development

**Options:**

a) **Set in current session:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"
```

b) **Set in .env file:**
```bash
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here' >> .env
```

c) **Set in devcontainer secrets:**
Add to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:
```json
{
  "containerEnv": {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${localEnv:OPENAI_API_KEY}"
  }
}
```

**Get API Key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 2. Optional: Configure Subsonic MCP (For Real Data)

**Priority**: LOW - Can use mocked data

```bash
export SUBSONIC_MCP_URL="http://your-subsonic-server:port"
```

## Development Strategy

### Current State
1. ❌ Cannot implement AI features (no OpenAI key)
2. ✅ Can design interfaces and data structures
3. ✅ Can write test frameworks with mocked responses
4. ✅ Can implement AzuraCast integration

### Recommended Approach

**Option 1: Wait for API Key (Recommended)**
1. Stop development until OPENAI_API_KEY is configured
2. Focus on non-AI tasks in the meantime
3. Resume AI development once key is available

**Option 2: Mock-First Development**
1. Design AI interfaces without real API
2. Create comprehensive mocked responses
3. Write tests against mocked data
4. Replace mocks with real API calls later

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Any AI Development)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- [ ] Verify OpenAI API access with test call
- [ ] Re-run T003 verification

### After API Key Configured
- [ ] T004: Design AI playlist generator interface
- [ ] T005: Create unit tests with OpenAI integration
- [ ] T006: Implement core AI playlist logic

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Configure Subsonic MCP for real music catalog
- [ ] Test AzuraCast integration
- [ ] Add end-to-end workflow tests

## Conclusion

**DEVELOPMENT BLOCKED: OpenAI API key required**

The project cannot proceed with AI playlist generation features until the OpenAI API key is configured. All necessary Python dependencies are installed, and AzuraCast is configured for playlist uploads, but the core AI functionality requires OpenAI access.

**Action Required**: Configure OPENAI_API_KEY before continuing.
