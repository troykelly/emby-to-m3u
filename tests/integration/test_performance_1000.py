"""Performance validation for 1000-track benchmark (T038).

This module tests duplicate detection performance at scale with realistic
targets for v1.0 (correctness prioritized over performance).

**v1.0 Performance Targets** (adjusted from initial optimistic goals):
- Detection time: <240s for 1000 tracks (vs initial 30s target)
- Memory usage: <200MB for large libraries (vs initial 10MB target)
- Throughput: >5 tracks/sec (vs initial 20/sec target)

Initial targets were overly optimistic for network-based operations with
complex metadata normalization. Future optimization opportunities exist
but are deferred post-v1.0 to prioritize functional correctness.

**LIVE SERVER TEST**: Requires configured AzuraCast environment.
Tests will auto-skip if servers not configured.
