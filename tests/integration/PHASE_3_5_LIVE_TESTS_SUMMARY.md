**Run specific test module**:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_ai_playlist_generation.py -v -m live
```

**Run with coverage**:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_*.py --cov=src/ai_playlist --cov-report=html -v -m live

## Test Markers

All tests use pytest markers:
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration test marker
- `@pytest.mark.live` - Requires live environment variables

Tests automatically skip if required environment variables are missing.

## Live Data Validation

✅ **NO MOCKS USED** - All tests use:

- Live Subsonic/Emby music library
- Live OpenAI API (actual costs incurred)
- Live Last.fm API
- Live file system (fcntl locking)
- Live SQLite database

## Implementation Notes

### Test Organization
- All tests in `/workspaces/emby-to-m3u/tests/integration/`
- Clear separation of concerns (one file per feature)
- Comprehensive fixtures for reusability
- Skip logic for missing environment variables

### Error Handling
- Graceful skipping when env vars missing
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Proper cleanup on failures
- Timeout handling for long operations

### Performance Considerations
- Large query tests (<10s for 500 tracks)
- Batch generation tests (<5 minutes)
- Metadata enhancement batch (<30s for 20 tracks)
- All tests optimized for CI/CD

### Cost Control
- Tests use small budgets to avoid excessive costs
- Suggested mode for most tests (warnings only)
- Hard mode tests use very low budgets ($2-5)
- All costs tracked and reported

## MCP Coordination

All test results stored via MCP hooks:
```bash
# Pre-task hook
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Live Integration Tests T020-T030"

# Post-edit hook
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "tests/integration/test_*.py" \
  --memory-key "swarm/tester/t020-t030/live-tests"

# Post-task hook
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "T020-T030"
```

Results stored in `/workspaces/emby-to-m3u/.swarm/memory.db` for swarm coordination.

## Next Steps

After Phase 3.5 completion:
1. **Phase 3.6**: Implement core services to make tests pass
2. **Phase 3.7**: Live end-to-end validation
3. **Phase 3.8**: Contract test validation

## Total Test Count

- **11 test files created**
- **~85+ individual test cases**
- **All marked with `@pytest.mark.integration` and `@pytest.mark.live`**
- **100% live data, zero mocks**
