"""Live integration tests for AzuraCast upload and duplicate detection (T013-T014).

These tests upload actual tracks to a live AzuraCast server and verify:
- T013: Initial upload of 10 tracks succeeds
- T014: Duplicate detection on second run (0 uploads expected)

Prerequisites:
- Live Subsonic server with test playlist configured
- Live AzuraCast server with API access
- Environment variables in .env file
